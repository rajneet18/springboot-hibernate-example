In a Spring Boot application using Hibernate, a One-to-Many mapping is a relationship where one entity is related to multiple entities. For example, a Department can have many Employees. This relationship is typically represented in the database with a foreign key in the "many" side table (i.e., the Employee table).

Steps to implement One-to-Many relationship in Spring Boot with Hibernate:
Define the entities: Create the Department and Employee classes, and use the appropriate annotations to establish the One-to-Many relationship.

Define the relationship in JPA:

In the Department class, we use @OneToMany to indicate the one-to-many relationship with Employee.
In the Employee class, we use @ManyToOne to define the inverse side of the relationship.
Create repositories: Use Spring Data JPA repositories for both entities.

Write service and controller logic to handle data operations.
In this scenario, we have a one-to-many relationship between Department and Employee.
The @OneToMany annotation is used on the Department entity to represent that one department can have many employees.
The @ManyToOne annotation is used on the Employee entity to reference the department each employee belongs to.
The cascade = CascadeType.ALL ensures that if a department is saved, its employees will be saved automatically as well.
